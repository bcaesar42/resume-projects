This is a GUI program that allows users to upload and download files from AWS S3 cloud storage.

This is only the .java file for the program.
In order for this program to compile and run on your machine:
  1.) You must have the AWS SDK for Java.
  2.) You must link the SDK to the program.
  3.) You must have credentials for an AWS account.
I recommend using Eclipse for Java Enterprise Edition, with the AWS extension.
